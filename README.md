# ðŸŽµ Music Theory Anki Cards

This repository contains scripts for generating Anki cards suitable for
practicing different music theory concepts. All the cards are generated
programmatically, for all different keys. The required images are either
fetched from the web or generated as needed using Matplotlib.

## Decks

- [Circle of Fifths](circle_of_fifths.py):
  - relative major/minor keys,
  - number of accidentals,
  - key signatures,
  - accidentals in each key,
  - perfect fourths and fifths between keys.
